# Financial Fraud Detection Using XAI Methods

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting financial fraud using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The dataset used is the **Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection (Log format)**, which is preprocessed to create a smaller, manageable dataset for model training and testing.

Key components of the project:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Creating a smaller dataset for efficient processing.
2. **Modeling:** Using Isolation Forest adn Random Forest along with explainability tools to detect and interpret fraud patterns.
3. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance and explainability metrics.

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or higher). 
Install the required packages using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Preprocess the Dataset
Run the `preprocess_data.py` script to create a smaller, manageable dataset

## Run the model
Run the file `fraud_detection.ipynb`
